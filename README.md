# ColoRandom
### ABSTRACT
 The Colorandom site generates random color palettes for the user and allows the users to select colors to ‘save’. Users are able to ‘lock’ colors from the randomly generated palettes and that color will persist when they generate a new palette. The user is able to ‘unlock’ colors as well and those will be replaced by random colors when the new palette generates. They can keep ‘locking’ and saving palettes as long as they’d like, but cannot save the same palette twice. The user will have the opportunity delete palettes once they are saved, this will not prevent them from not being saved again. None of the saved palettes will persist on page load.

### LEARNING GOALS
* Write semantic HTML and efficient CSS to form a usable UI
* Write clean, DRY JavaScript and leverage functions, creating and using an effective data model
* Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
* Refine your collaboration skills

### WINS + CHALLENGES 
#### Wins: 
- It works !
- Our group dynamic was great. Everyone was able to contribute, had an understanding of what was happening in the code and despite the time differences able to code together for the entirety  of the project. 
- Everyone's individual knowledge came together nicely to solve problems, we all feel that we each learned what we needed to learn from the project and cement learning objectives. 
#### Challenges: 
- The toggleLocks function in our JS code was tricky to set up. The closest() method was used here, for this we had to ensure the color’s id matched the id of the box element. Getting these id attributes to match was challenging in that we had to experiment with numerous ways to get them to match. 
- We thought the delete function was going to be a lot simpler than it was, we assumed it would take 30 minutes to get it functional, but it took closer to 2 hours. 
- Scheduling across three different timezones.
