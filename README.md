# ColoRandom
### ABSTRACT
 The Colorandom site generates random color palettes for the user and allows the users to select colors to ‘save’. Users are able to ‘lock’ colors from the randomly generated palettes and that color will persist when they generate a new palette. The user is able to ‘unlock’ colors as well and those will be replaced by random colors when the new palette generates. They can keep ‘locking’ and saving palettes as long as they’d like, but cannot save the same palette twice. The user will have the opportunity delete palettes once they are saved, this will not prevent them from not being saved again. None of the saved palettes will persist on page load.
